- How to make a function accept an unknown number of argumenst in c

- https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optix-a-new-look-for-gpu-ray-tracing-in-film-and-design/
- look for a good folder structure
- each header file should have the definitions first then the declarations
- think how each function should accept values or references, and similary do they need to return new objects or manipulate existing ones
- all the header files in a separete folder, all tests in a different folder
- the scripts that create visualisations at the end of each chapter in a separete folder
- Makefile to run tests and sync that with github actions
- comments for important function, about what they return and accept as arguments
