This is a C implementation of the Ray tracing challenge book. It basically simulates any scene by simulating a ray of light bouncing off of different objects untill it finally hits the canvas. 
Picking this project up to learn 
- learn c language
- test driven developement
- SOLID design patterns
- Accelerate the code using the CUDA-C library

Implementation after chapter 7
